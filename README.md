# Lista de Tarefas

This project is a simple yet effective To-Do List application built using JavaScript. 
The purpose is to provide users with a user-friendly interface to manage their tasks, add new ones, mark completed tasks, and remove them as needed.

Users can add new tasks to the list, providing a clear description of the task. Tasks can be marked as completed, allowing users to track their progress easily.
JavaScript is employed to dynamically update the task list without requiring a page reload. This ensures a smooth and seamless user experience. Users can remove completed or unwanted tasks from the list with a simple interaction.
Implement local storage to persist the task list data. This ensures that the user's task data is retained even if they refresh the page or revisit the site later.
